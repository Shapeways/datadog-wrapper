Datadog Wrapper
===============
Code to send information from php apps to Datadog's StatsD implementation, including parameters for Datadog-specific features such as tags.

This package was extracted from [App-Infrastructure](https://github.com/Shapeways/app-infrastructure) so that it could be included in smaller components without baggage.
